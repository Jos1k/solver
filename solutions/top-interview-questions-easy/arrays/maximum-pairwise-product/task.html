<h2>Maximum Pairwise Product</h2>
Maximum Pairwise Product Problem
Find the maximum product of two distinct num- bers in a sequence of non-negative integers.
Input: A sequence of non-negative integers.
Output: The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the se- quence.
Given a sequence of non-negative integers a1,...,an, compute max ai*aj.

Note that i and j should be different, though it may be the case that ai = aj .
Input format. The first line contains an integer n. The next line contains n non-negative integers a1,...,an (separated by spaces).
Output format. The maximum pairwise product.
Constraints. 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; 0≤a1,...,an ≤ 2*10^5.
